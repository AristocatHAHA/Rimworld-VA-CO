[size=10pt][color=white]Description:[/color][/size]

VA-CO try to reduce frustratingness of combat by increasing survival rate of colonists while decreasing ever frustrating permanent injury.

Although goal of this mod isn't realism, realistically a person wouldn't fight until their torso is completely destroyed, bleeding out is most common cause of death and I think these mods archived realism fairly well.

In a way this is basically mini-Combat Realism mod except these mods doesn't touch weapons and should be compatible with almost everything.

Ironically, increasing pain is opposite of hardcore because when a colonist goes down they don't aggro anymore attack, which means they will survive, and while the enemy will die quicker from pain.

All three are separated and you can play as you like.

[size=10pt][color=white]Blood and Pain :[/color][/size]

- Injuries cause bleeding three times more.

- Injuries cause twice more pain and thrice for non-bleeding injuries(ex, bruises).

- Blood loss causes pain and more severe conscious lose.

- Punctured organs now cause three times severe bleeding. (In vanilla, punctured kidney, lungs and liver etc doesn't cause additional blood loss, only heart and neck does.)

- Go Juice pain reduction increased to 80% from 10%, and now increase blood filtration and blood pumping.

The problem of vanilla is that risk of permanent injury is too high and that encourages extremely defensive tactics, such as killbox turtling. VA-CO mod try to support every style of play. Grab shotguns and flank them, get the longsword and shove it up in the raider ass. Hell, you can even play full brawler monks(Though, that would be hard.).

Colonists are more likely survive and less likely lose body parts, but more likely dies from blood loss if not treated quick enough. Most dies within 2 to 4 hours depend on injuries.

Battles are shorter and more decisive. Pawns are no longer bullet sponges that can soak up dozens of bullets before goes down.

Melee is more viable as the risk of permanent injury is lower and raiders go down quicker, thus take less hit. Also, Personal Shield is relatively stronger, or rather everyone(except mechs) are weaker.

Raiders are more likely incapped, if you can capture them before they bleed-out.

Relatively, mechanoids are stronger as they don't feel pain or bleed. Tribes, insects and manhunter packs are somewhat weaker, although they are still deadly if you let them engage in close range without the melee weapons.

Hunts are shorter as most things go down with 2 to 5 shots, depend on the gun.

If you have full bionic colonist or any mod that allows you to craft mechs they make incredible fighters as they don't bleed nor feel pain.

As bleeding and pain are caused by the damage an injury dealt, having armor is incredibly important.

Go juice is now more viable tactical option, as it reduces pain which make extremely deadly soldier.

Vanilla : Pawns are basically bullet sponges and take dozens of shot to down. Permanent injury is far too common. Bleeding is pretty much none existence.

VA-CO : Injuries that would have killed or permanently injure colonists instead down them, as long as you have won the battle and got enough doctors patch them up they can survive the day and fight next fight.
